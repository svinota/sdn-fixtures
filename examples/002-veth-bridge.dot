    # In a veth definition, it is enough to describe the peer — the local
    # port will be assigned an automatic name. An edge (veth -> bridge)
    # instructs the script to connect the local port to the bridge.

    # If you want to display IP address information on the diagram, you
    # can use a node name like "{name}:ip" with shape=note — for example,
    # "port0:ip" and "br0:ip". You must also create an edge from "{name}"
    # to "{name}:ip" in order to associate the address information with
    # the interface.
